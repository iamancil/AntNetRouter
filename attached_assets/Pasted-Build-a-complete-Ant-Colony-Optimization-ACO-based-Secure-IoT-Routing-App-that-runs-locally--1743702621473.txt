Build a complete **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)-based Secure IoT Routing App** that runs **locally** on a user's machine. Do not make a cloud-based web app. Instead, generate **all necessary files** so I can **download and run them locally**.

### ðŸ”¹ Core Features:
1. **ACO-Based Secure Routing**:
   - Implement **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** to find the most secure and efficient paths in an IoT network.
   - If a node (device) is **compromised or suspicious**, reduce its pheromone level dynamically.
   - Ensure real-time updating of pheromone levels based on detected security threats.

2. **Simple Yet Powerful GUI**:
   - Use **Tkinter (Python)** or **Electron.js (JavaScript)** for an easy-to-use **desktop interface**.
   - The GUI should display:
     - A **network visualization** of IoT devices.
     - **Traffic analysis logs** (normal vs. suspicious activities).
     - **Optimal secure routes** found by the ACO algorithm.

3. **Database Integration (MongoDB)**:
   - Store **network traffic data**, including device activity, security scores, and routing logs.
   - Provide **APIs or direct queries** to fetch and analyze stored data.

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Monitor **anomalous behavior** (e.g., excessive requests, unusual data flow).
   - If a node **acts suspiciously**, flag it and update routing dynamically.

5. **Local Execution Setup**:
   - Generate a **setup script (install.sh or setup.py)** to install dependencies.
   - The app should run **on Linux & Windows without relying on an online backend**.

### ðŸ”¹ Additional Requirements:
- **Make all project files downloadable** for **local execution**.
- Do **not** use cloud-based databases or hosting services.
- Include **clear documentation** on how to install and run the app locally.

Generate **all the required files**, including:
âœ… Python files for **ACO routing & security logic**  
âœ… GUI files using **Tkinter or Electron.js**  
âœ… MongoDB integration scripts  
âœ… A **setup script** for easy installation  

Make sure the app follows **best practices for cybersecurity and performance**. The UI should be **clean, intuitive, and informative**.
